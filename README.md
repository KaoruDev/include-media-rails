## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'include_media_rails', '~> 1.4'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install include_media_rails

## Usage

in a `sass` file (`app/assets/stylsheets/application.scss` for example):

```sass
@import "include_media";
```


## Dependencies

- Rails `>= 3.1` and `<5` (not tested)
- Sass `>=3.3` and `<4` (include_media requires `sass maps`)


## Versioning

`*.*.*` points to the `include_media` version. i.e. `v1.4.2` comes with
include_media's `v1.4.2`. **NOTE** I started this gem when
`include_media` was at `v1.4.2`. Earilier versions are _not_ currently supported.

The last number (`1.4.2.*` ) points to minor changes made to the gem itself.

Available versions:
```
1.4.2.1
1.4.3
1.4.5
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To quickly update `include-media` run `gulp update`. It will pull the
latest version from `npm` and copy `include-media` to the
`vendor/assets/stylesheets` directory.

To pull down a specific version of `include-media` pass in a `--version` flag
and set it to the target version. ie: `gulp update --version=1.4.2`
